# Introduction
## Fake news and misinformation on social media platforms have emerged as a critical issue confronting our information ecosystem. The viral spread of fabricated content poses a unique challenge on social media, where misinformation can quickly reach millions of users and skew public opinion. While previous computational methods for detecting fake news have been proposed, more improvements are required to address the evolving tactics of misinformation campaigns. Prior detection efforts have focused mainly on analyzing news content from professional outlets rather than user-generated posts. This highlights a research gap in detecting fake news directly from social media. To fill this void, this project aims to create a system capable of detecting fabricated news on social media. To accurately detect fake news tweets, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques, and machine learning (ML), a type of machine learning model well-suited for textual data. The main goal is to find the best ML architectures and feature representations for this task. This project will provide insights into optimal machine learning approaches for combating fake news on social media and other social platforms through extensive experiments. The findings will bring us one step closer to mitigating the real-world consequences of viral misinformation. Overall, this work addresses a critical need for improved fake news detection capabilities that are sensitive to the unique challenges that social media content presents.
## In this project we will use dataset from Kaggle. We found a dataset that will help us that has a total of 44921 samples about fake news and true news.
